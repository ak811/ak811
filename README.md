Hello, my name is Ali, and I am a second-year PhD student majoring in Computer Science at UNC Charlotte. My research focuses on computer vision and deep
learning, with a particular interest in transformers, state space models, and the
self-attention mechanism. I enjoy exploring how these architectures can improve
the efficiency and accuracy of visual recognition tasks and other real-world applications. Alongside my research, I have gained strong programming experience
in Python and deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow. I am
excited to continue advancing my expertise while collaborating with others in
pushing the boundaries of AI.

Some highlights from my CV:
