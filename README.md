Hello! My name is Ali Khaleghi Rahimian, and I have recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer engineering from Yazd University. My research primarily focuses on the intersection of computer vision and machine learning. I am particularly interested in developing computer vision and machine learning algorithms for robot control.
