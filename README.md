Hi, my name is Ali Khaleghi, and I have recently completed my undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering from Yazd University. My research centers around deep learning and machine learning, specifically their application in computer vision, natural language processing, software systems, and autonomous agents.

Some highlights from my CV:
- Certificate of Achievement (Honorable Mention) in the 17th [International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC)](https://icpc.global/) - Nov 2019
- Ranked 4th in the 3rd national [Sharif Spaghetti Programming Contest](http://spaghetticontest.sharif.ir/) - Dec 2019
- Ranked 10th in the final round of the 6th national [JavaCup Programming Contest](https://javacup.ir/contest/) - Oct 2019
- Ranked 31st in the 7th national [Mobile Programming Marathon](http://mpm.sharif.ir/) - Sep 2019
- Ranked 3rd in the 3rd national [Sharif ICT Challenge Programming Contest](http://ictchallenge.sharif.ir/) - Aug 2019
