Hello, my name is Ali, and I am a second-year PhD student majoring in Computer Science at UNC Charlotte. My research focuses on computer vision and deep
learning, with a particular interest in transformers, state space models, and the
self-attention mechanism. I enjoy exploring how these architectures can improve
the efficiency and accuracy of visual recognition tasks and other real-world applications. Alongside my research, I have gained strong programming experience
in Python and deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow. I am
excited to continue advancing my expertise while collaborating with others in
pushing the boundaries of AI.

Some highlights from my CV:
- 2nd Place — JCAL Programming Contest *(May 2018)*
- 3rd Place — Sharif ICT Challenge *(Aug 2019)*
- 4th Place — Sharif Spaghetti Programming Contest *(Dec 2019)*
- 10th Place — JavaCup Programming Contest *(Oct 2019)*
- 31st Place — Mobile Programming Marathon *(Sep 2019)*
- Certificate of Achievement — 17th ICPC *(Nov 2019)*
